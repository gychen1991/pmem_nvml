NAME
       pmempool-create - Create Persistent Memory Pool of specified type

SYNOPSIS
       pmempool create [<options>] [<type>] [<bsize>] <file>

DESCRIPTION
       The  pmempool invoked with create command creates a pool file of speci‐
       fied type. Depending on a pool type it  is  possible  to  provide  more
       properties of pool.

       Valid  pool types are: blk, log and obj which stands for pmemblk, pmem‐
       log and pmemobj pools respectively.  By default the pool file  is  cre‐
       ated  with  minimum  allowed  size for specified pool type. The minimum
       sizes for blk, log and  obj  pool  types  are  PMEMBLK_MIN_POOL,  PMEM‐
       LOG_MIN_POOL  and  PMEMOBJ_MIN_POOL  respectively.  See  libpmemblk(3),
       libpmemlog(3) and libpmemobj(3) for details.

       For pmemblk pool type block size <bsize> is a required argument.

       In order to set custom size of pool use -s option, or use -M option  to
       create a pool of maximum available size on underlying file system.

       The  size  argument  may be passed with multiplicative suffixes K=1024,
       M=1024*1024 and so  on  for  G,  T  and  P  or  the  suffixes  KB=1000,
       MB=1000*1000 and so on for GB, TB and PB.

   Available options:
       -s, --size <size>
               Size of pool file.

       -M, --max-size
               Set size of pool to available space of underlying file system.

       -m, --mode <octal>
               Set permissions to <octal> (the default is 0664).

       -i, --inherit <file>
               Create  a  new  pool  of  the same size and other properties as
               <file>.

       -v, --verbose
               Increase verbosity level.

       -h, --help
               Display help message and exit.

   Options for PMEMBLK:
       By default when creating a pmem blk pool, the BTT layout is not written
       until  the  first write operation of block entry is performed. Using -w
       option you can force writing BTT layout by writing zero data to  speci‐
       fied block number. By default the write operation is performed to block
       number 0.  Please refer to libpmemblk(3) for details.

       -w, --write-layout [<blockno>]
               Force writing BTT  layout  by  performing  write  operation  to
               <blockno> block. Default is 0.

   Options for PMEMOBJ:
       By  default  when creating a pmem obj pool, the layout name provided to
       the libpmemobj library is an empty string.  Please  refer  to  libpmem‐
       obj(3) for details.

       -l, --layout <layout>
               Layout name of the pmemobj pool.

EXAMPLES
       pmempool create blk 512 pool.blk
              #  Create a blk pool file of minimum allowed size and block size
              512 bytes

       pmempool create log -M pool.log
              # Create a log pool file of maximum allowed size

       pmempool create blk --size=4G --write-layout=1 1K pool.blk
              # Create a blk pool file of size 4G, block size 1K and write BTT
              layout using write operation to the block number 1

       pmempool create --layout my_layout obj pool.obj
              #  Create  an  obj  pool file of minimum allowed size and layout
              'my_layout'

       pmempool create --inherit=pool.log new_pool.log
              # Create a pool file based on pool.log file
