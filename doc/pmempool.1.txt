NAME
       pmempool - Persistent Memory Pool Management Tool

SYNOPSIS
       pmempool [--help] [--version] <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       The pmempool is a management tool for Persistent Memory pool files cre‐
       ated by NVML libraries.

       The main purpose of pmempool is to provide a user with a set of  utili‐
       ties  for  off-line  analysis and manipulation of pools created by pmem
       libraries. The pmempool is a generic command which consists of  subcom‐
       mands  for  specific purposes. Some of subcommands are required to work
       without any impact on processed pool, but some of them may create a new
       or modify an existing one.

       The pmempool may be useful for troubleshooting by system administrators
       and for software developers who work  on  applications  based  on  NVML
       library.  The latter may find these tools useful for testing and debug‐
       ging purposes also.
